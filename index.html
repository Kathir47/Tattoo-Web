					<h3>How much a tattoo costs?</h3><br><br>
					<p>Knowing how much your tattoo will cost will help with planning for your dream tattoo.<br><br>

					Many factors determine the price charged by the tattoo artist: Skill, reputation, artistic ability, location on the body, size of the tattoo, and complexity.<br><br>

					Typically, a quality tattoo performed in a registered professional tattoo studio or parlor would be more expensive than some scratcher working out of his back room. Considering that you could potentially take home a disease along with a crappy permanent tattoo, paying a little more can certainly be worth the cost in the long run.<br><br>

					In general, the old adage applies that you get what you pay for. Though there’s no guarantee that the quality of the tattoo increases with its cost, at least you can ensure that you’re somewhere on the playing field.</p>
